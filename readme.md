# ÃŸA Super Mario RPG! (supposedly)
* A testing project to learn assembly using the well document SMBDIS file on Github (https://gist.github.com/1wErt3r/4048722)
* Uses cc65 to assemble the asm file into a .nes version
* Uses the Nintaco NES emulator to run the game automatically after build, or can run specific builds using run.sh
* Only compatibility with mac OS tested, use the assembler at your own peril.
